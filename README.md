## The ASP.NET Vue Starter Template

This is the starter template for ASP.NET and Vue, which will hopefully get you off the ground quickly. Further instructions for how to use this template are in `templates/README.md`.

To install this template, simply:

```
dotnet new install Vue.Web.Starter::1.0.0
```

Which will allow you to:

```
dotnet new vue
```
